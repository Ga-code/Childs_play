The save file format will be CSV (Comma Separated Values), which looks
like this:

	Username,Password,bio
	idk,$2b$10$iGvXYYVUweDxupdQPpDPFu4MobfdwbuJO9eFktB2LVnk00dLKomrG,i dont know

We will use this for loading game data as a structure:

	typedef struct game {
		char name[32];
		char data[32];
	} game;

Let's initialize this game by making a game structure called "mygame":

	game mygame;

Now that it has been created, it has been assigned a place in memory.
For our example, lets say that place is 0xfffc5878.

	Decimal | Hexadecimal
	--------|------------
	32      | 0x20

16 = 0x10
16 * 2 = 32, so 32 = 0x20.

If each item in "mygame" is 32 (0x20) bytes long, then one can switch their base address by 0x20 in order to switch to "name" and "data";

	mygame starts at 0xfffc5878
		.name at 0xfffc5878 - 0xfffc5897
		.data at 0xfffc5898 - 0xfffc58b7
	ends at 0xfffc58b8

Make sure you remember basic arithmetic. It helps.
